# ML_Agents_Project
A Unity group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "ML Agents"

The purpose of the assignment was to create a mini 2D or 3D game
training intelligent Agents within the Unity environment. We
created a 3D game by checking how artificial intelligence works
avoiding players with ML-Agents. More specifically we made one
agent (a robot) that must avoid a collision with a car
(target). Also, changes to target speed are applied to you
show how intelligent the agent is to apply changes to
frequency of movement.

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
